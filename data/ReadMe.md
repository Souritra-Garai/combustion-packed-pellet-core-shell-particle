## Input Data for Pellet Flame Propagation

This directory contains the values of pellet properties, species properties etc. All physical properties are in their SI units.

The `species` directory contains thermo-physical data on ideal gases and condensed species.

The `core-shell-particle` directory contains data regarding dimension, composition and Arrhenius diffusivity model for the core-shell-particle.

The `pellet` directory contains dimension and heat loss coefficient data for the pellet. It also contains the gas data residing in the interstices of the pellet.

The `PDE-solver-config` directory contains data on dicretization of pellet, core-shell particle and time steps.

The `diffusivity-parameters` contains parameters from various sources to calculate diffusivity coefficient using Arrhenius law model at different temperatures.
