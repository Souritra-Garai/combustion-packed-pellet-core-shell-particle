\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This header file defines a class for solving 2D matrix equations of the form A.\+x = b (where A is an n x n matrix and x and b are n x 1 vectors) using QR factorization technique. Also the class is implemented in such a way that it may be parallelized easily using openmp constructs. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
