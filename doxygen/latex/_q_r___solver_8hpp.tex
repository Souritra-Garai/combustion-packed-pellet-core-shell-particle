\label{_q_r___solver_8hpp}\index{include/QR\_Solver.hpp@{include/QR\_Solver.hpp}}


This header file defines a class for solving 2D matrix equations of the form A.\+x = b (where A is an n x n matrix and x and b are n x 1 vectors) using QR factorization technique. Also the class is implemented in such a way that it may be parallelized easily using openmp constructs.
